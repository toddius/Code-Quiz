# Code-Quiz
timed quiz about Javascript facts

I first created the HTML file to produce the general structure I saw in the gif provided. I created a nav bar with a link to the high scores (not active as pof this point) and the countdown time (which is working). 

I also create a centerd container that could hold multiple divs that could be revealed or hidden with CSS. I was able to produce the home page to start the game and hide it with a click of the start button and produce the div that holds the quesiton with answers. I started working on the end of game div and did not start the high scores div that would hold all the high scores.

Initially, I made separate divs for all the questions, but after speaking with a TA, they recommended I put all the questions and answers into an array of objects. After I did that, I tried to create a loop that would populate the div elements with the questions and answers. I got it to 'work' but it always went to the end of the array. 

Another problem I am having is deterrmining which answer the user chooses so I can determine if it is right or wrong and code for what the game to do next. 

I just need to solve how to create the quesitons one at a time and determine the answer chosen, then I can move forward to completing this game.
